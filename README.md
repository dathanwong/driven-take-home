This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Current Issues

All features are currently working except for the save button. Currently I have an array to show the locations of each checker piece and it is successfully being saved to session when save button is clicked. The issue is when loading the page the state for the checker pieces is being reset after the page loads.
